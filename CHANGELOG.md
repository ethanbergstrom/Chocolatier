## [1.0.1] - 2020-01-19 - The Great Fork
### Added
* Searching/installing/managing multiple Chocolatey sources
* DSC Compatibility, including additional package arguments
* 'Upgrade' packages using the 'latest' required version keyword
  * Thanks to @matthewprenger for help with this

### Changed
* To facilitate readability, broke up main module file into several function files
  * Grouped by 'public' functions used by PackageManagement vs 'private' functions that contain much of the shared logic for interacting with choco.exe
  * Common logic, such as building commands, sending them to choco.exe, and parsing results, are consolidated across multiple PackageManagement cmdlets into a single set of helper functions

### Fixed
* Get-Package no longer lists 'chocolatey' twice
* Improved performance when downloading large packages with embedded installers

### Removed
* With Chocolatey-managed upgrades via the provider now available, the package provider no longer unilaterally upgrades Chocolatey on invocation if already installed
* No longer displays progress bars in order to simplify passing data between functions via the pipeline in a way that's idiomatic to PowerShell
